I have ordered here before during the lockdown and now I eat here in the restaurant itself for the first time. It is just super tasty. Quality is excellent! Staff is friendly, some speak English, no problem for us, but what is often the case in tapas restaurants that you have a well-filled wallet to take along. That is not only here, but you do get value for money! Everything is equally delicious!</p>

Everything. We were with my children, who also liked everything (10-13-16). And for the youngest one, they made a special ice cream dessert. Delicious!

                        <p className='rev-text'>Tapas, every single one, delicious. Very friendly staff. First we sat outside, but it started to rain. In no time, the tables were inside, neatly spaced out, and everyone could continue eating there. When I went to report after the payment that they had counted only two wines instead of 4, it was so appreciated that we were offered those two wines from the company! Top!</p>
